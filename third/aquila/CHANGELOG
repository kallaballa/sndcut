=Changes=

==3.0.0==
  * Some C++11 features
  * still hell of a work to do ;)

==2.5.3==
  * optimized Mel filtering, resulting in a huge performance increase with MFCC

==2.5.2==
  * started to introduce Boost C++ libraries in some places
  * added a console textual progress indicator using boost

==2.5.1==
  * added slight optimization in FFT (5-20% faster, depending on frame size)
  * added HFCC features

==2.5.0==
  * slightly optimized WaveFile load() method
  * major optimization in DCT calculations (40-50% faster computation!)

==2.4.3==
  * optimized DTW calculation
  * added DTW lowest-cost path recovery
  * added two different DTW pass types - neighbors and diagonals

==2.4.2==
  * added different distance functions to DTW

==2.4.1==
  * fixed a nasty bug in MfccExtractor concerning enabling Mel filters

==2.4.0==
  * ported DTW calculation from 1.3.1
  * allowed for different DTW distance normalizations

==2.3.2==
  * added MelFiltersBank::setEnabledFilters() to allow mass enabling/disabling Mel filters
  * added FeatureReader::readHeader()

==2.3.1==
  * added WaveFile::recalculate() method for quick frame recalculating without the need to reload whole file

==2.3.0==
  * redesigned reading/writing of feature objects
  * created FeatureReader and FeatureWriter interfaces

==2.2.1==
  * added sample by sample access to WaveFile class
  * Transform class is non-static (again :-P)

==2.2.0==
  * ported MFCC feature extraction from 1.3.1

==2.1.0==
  * ported Mel-scale filters

==2.0.2==
  * optimized FFT calculations

==2.0.1==
  * sample preparing and Fourier transform is handled by the Transform class
  * Frame and WaveFile now do not depend on any other classes

==2.0.0==
  * ported some of old classes from 1.3.1 to new project
  * huge refactoring of old code
  * reduced dependency between objects
  * separated configuration from calculation
