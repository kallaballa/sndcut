Contribution guide
==================

Do you want to contribute to Aquila? Here's a short guide how you can help.

Report issues
-------------

If you think you found a **bug** in Aquila or have an awesome **feature
request**, feel free to [file an issue](http://github.com/zsiciarz/aquila/issues).
Aquila relies on GitHub for issue tracking. Please, search through existing
issues before you file a new one; perhaps your problem was already discussed
or fixed.

When submitting an issue, please include the following:

 * problem description
 * steps to reproduce (a smallest possible code example that reproduces the
   issue would be most welcome!)
 * expected outcome
 * actual outcome
 * platform information: your operating system, compiler version, build type etc.
 * any other relevant information

Contribute code
---------------

Contributions to Aquila source code are accepted only as either **git patches**
or **pull requests** on GitHub (which are the preferred way). Fork the project,
work on it in your repository and when you think your patch is ready, send
us a pull request.

-------

By contributing your code, you agree to license your contribution under
the terms of MIT license (see `LICENSE` file for details).
